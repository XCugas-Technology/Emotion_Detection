# Emotion_Detection
 Emotions play a significant and powerful role in everyday life of human beings. Developing algorithms for computers to recognize emotional expression is a widely studied area. In this study, emotion recognition from Galvanic signals was performed using time domain and wavelet based features. Feature extraction has been done with various feature set attributes. Various length windows have been used for feature extraction. Various feature attribute sets have been implemented. Valence and arousal have been categorized and relationship between physiological signals and arousal and valence has been studied using Random Forest machine learning algorithm. We have achieved 71.53% and 71.04% accuracy rate for arousal and valence respectively by using only galvanic skin response signal. We have also showed that using convolution has positive affect on accuracy rate compared to non-overlapping window based feature extraction
